# RocketChat Channel Icons:

You can find the channel icons that are currently used on RocketChat, where the names match the channel name. If you are creating a new general channel maintained by platform-services team, please generate it from https://flaticons.net/free-icons, and use the BCGov color #036 and #fcba19!
